  //   the Slot struct below to 16 bits each, and likewise
  //   some local variables in the .cpp file that hold size-
  //   related values.  (And this constant, of course.)
  // (Or some extra code could manually limit macros to 255
  //   keystrokes each, and keep 'usedSize' at 8 bits, even if
  //   'macroStart' and 'allocatedSize' still need to be 16 bits each.)

  //   for that case vs. just changing the number here.
